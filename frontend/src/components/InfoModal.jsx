					<p className="text-white font-poppins text-xl pb-5">Some Notes About Habits</p>
					<p className="text-white font-poppins pl-6 pb-4">
						Habits are powerful tools for shaping behavior over time. They're essentially automatic actions that the brain
						learns to run on autopilot, saving effort, attention, and energy. Once a habit is formed, it requires less
						willpower to sustain, which is why habits are at the core of long-term change.
					</p>
					<p className="text-white font-poppins pl-6 pb-4">
						According to a 2009 study from University College London, it takes an average of 66 days for a new habit to
						become automatic. However, this number isn't fixed — depending on the complexity of the habit and the
						individual, it can range anywhere from 18 to 254 days. (Source)
					</p>
					<p className="text-white font-poppins pl-6 pb-4">
						What's more important than perfection is consistency. Missing a day doesn't erase progress, but regular
						repetition, especially in a consistent context — strengthens the behavior. That's why tracking your habits
						visually can be so effective: it creates awareness and helps reinforce patterns over time.
					</p>
					<p className="text-white font-poppins pl-6 pb-4">
						Habits aren't just about discipline, they're about designing systems that make the right actions easier and more frequent.
					</p>

					<p className="text-white font-poppins text-xl pb-5 font-[600]">Why I Made It?</p>
					<p className="text-white font-poppins pl-6 pb-4">
						Every habit tracker I've used simply sucked. And believe me, I've tried a lot of them. It's like they were designed by people who don't actually use them.
						Too many useless features nobody asked for, cluttering the app and making it impossible to focus.
						Half of them lock you behind paywalls or bombard you with annoying ads every two seconds.
						Some are only limited to one platform, which is annoying.
					</p>
					<p className="text-white font-poppins pl-6 pb-4">
						So I built this. Simple, no extra features, free, no ads, web-based, and open-source. Just what a habit tracker should be.

					<p className="text-white font-poppins text-xl pb-5 font-[600]">Why Its So Good?</p>
					<p className="text-white font-poppins pl-6 pb-4">
						This <a className="text-violet-500 hover:text-violet-700 transition-all" href="https://youtu.be/P6FORpg0KVo?si=akFxZggJpqhOKkcF">TED Talk</a> inspired me to build this.
						In speech, Luis von Ahn discussed the power of streaks and how they can make learning addictive.
						I decided to place a strong emphasis on streaks, each habit has a streak counter that resets if you miss a day. 
						There's also a "longest streak" stat that's always visible, showing your highest streak for a habit.

					<p className="text-white font-poppins text-xl pb-5 font-[600]">How To Use It?</p>
					<p className="text-white font-poppins pl-6 pb-4">
						First, figure out what habit you want to work on. This can be a bad habit you want to quit, or a good habit
						that you want to develop. Set a goal for how many times you want to do it, and add the habit in the app. 
						Leave the "goal" section empty or set it to 0 to have a habit without a specific goal.
						You can also set what days you want to do the habit. For example, if you like to develop working out habit, 
						you may want to repeat the habit only 3 days a week.

						All of your habits will be saved in your browser. None of your habit data will be sent to any server.
						This does mean, however, that syncing between devices is not currently possible. I may add that feature in the future, by allowing to create an account.
